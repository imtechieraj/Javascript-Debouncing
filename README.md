Javascript-Debouncing [Live Demo](https://thisisrajkumar.github.io/Javascript-Debouncing/).
(While check the demo : Open 1. inspect -> 2. console tab)

Debouncing is used for optimizing the performance of a web app.
Imagine, If you building a shopping card, user have picked lot of item to purchase and last event user is clicking on a purchase button. That point purchase order goes to the server. What if user clicks on that button accidentally twice in a quick succession. Does that mean order will go twice. It depends on how you design the system. But you can protect against that kind of behaviour using debounce function.
